Composer-Wordpress
==================

A base Composer.json file made to install Wordpress and some key plugins I use.

Installs Wordpress 3.6
Sets the Wordpress directory as "wp" in the root dir (yes, WP is installed in it's own directory)
Sets the wp-content folder to "app" in the root dir

Installs plugins:
* Advanced Custom Fields
* Custom Post Type UI

Also installs the Composer package WP-CLI.

I will continue to add more as I see fit. Looking to create something I can use as a base for most new projects.

Most of this is based on Scott Walkinshaw's "Using Composer with Wordpress" post.
